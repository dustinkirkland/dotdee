.SH NAME
dotdee \- convert a flat file into one dynamically generated from a .d directory

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdotdee\fP [--setup|--update|--undo] /PATH/TO/FILE

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdotdee\fP is an administrative utility useful for converting a flatfile into a dynamically generated file, from a .d directory.

The original path at /PATH/TO/FILE will be replaced with a symbolic link to /etc/dotdee/PATH/TO/FILE, which is dynamically generated by concatenating all of the files in /etc/dotdee/PATH/TO/FILE.d/*, per the order of the shell.

The Linux kernel's \fBinotify\fP(7) mechanism is used by \fBdotdee\fP running \fBiwatch\fP(1) against the \fI/etc/dotdee/\fP directory.  Any changes to the constituent files are automatically reflected in the constructed, dynamically generated file.
